# CrimeBusterBot
Project for the Dutch Open Hackathon 2018 #doh18


### Introduction

This tool takes a website name and analysis some parameters to detect if the
website is bogus.

We are analysing the content of the website, TLS/SSL certificate, *whois*
information, police and kadaster data, machine learning tools and other
attributes.

As an additional feature, the product also detects other similar websites
using content analysis and machine learning supervised algorithms.

### Possible improvments

- Doman scanners, such as *nmap*, *striker* etc.
- Online analysers, such as [*urlvoid*](http://www.urlvoid.com/).
- Extend existing features.
